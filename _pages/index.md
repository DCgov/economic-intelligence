###DMPED Economic Intelligence Dashboard

DMPED is using data to create positive change and build good government for the citizens of the District of Columbia. We focus on collecting and compiling information about our city, and in particular on the DC economic development priorities: jobs, quality affordable housing, and community-focused development.
