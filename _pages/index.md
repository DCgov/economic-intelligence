###DMPED Economic Intelligence Dashboard

DMPED is using data to create positive change and build good government for the citizens of the District of Columbia. We focus on collecting and compiling information about our city, and in particular on the DC economic development priorities: jobs, quality affordable housing, and community-focused development.

This site is an online version of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development's weekly dashboard. This dashboard is also transmitted to the City Administrator, the Mayor, and other senior staff, so they can be aware of economic trends and context.

It includes only data that is public, so certain indicators that DMPED uses are not included.

###Suggestions?
