## DMPED Economic Intelligence Dashboard

This repository is an online version of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development's weekly dashboard. This dashboard is also transmitted to the City Administrator, the Mayor, and other senior staff, so they can be aware of economic trends and context.

It includes only data that is in the public domain, so certain indicators that DMPED uses are not included.
